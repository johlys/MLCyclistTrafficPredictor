# Predicting Bicycle Traffic in Bergen

This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting the number of cyclists crossing the Nyg√•rd bridge using machine learning. The project is structured into two main Jupyter notebooks and is supported by raw data and generated files.

## Repository Structure
- `raw_data/`: Folder containing the CSV files used for the analysis.
- `data_preparation.ipynb`: Notebook for data preparation and exploratory analysis.
- `data-modeling.ipynb`: Notebook for the modeling phase of the project.
- Generated files from the notebooks (e.g., CSV files for training, validation, and predictions).

## Notebooks Overview

### `data-preparation.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on preparing and exploring the dataset. Key steps include:
- Loading and cleaning traffic and weather data.
- Visualizing various aspects such as monthly traffic patterns and correlations between traffic and weather conditions.
- Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.

### `data-modeling.ipynb`
In this notebook, we undertake the modeling phase, which involves:
- Implementing various regression models like KNN, Decision Tree, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regression.
- Evaluating these models to select the best performer based on RMSE.
- Making predictions for 2023 traffic data and visualizing these predictions.

## Data Sources
The data used is from: [Statens vegvesen](https://trafikkdata.atlas.vegvesen.no/) and [Geofysisk institutt](https://veret.gfi.uib.no/).

## Usage
To work with the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore and run the Jupyter notebooks in order, starting with `data-preparation.ipynb`.
3. Review the generated files for further insights and predictions.

## Requirements
- Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, and Seaborn.
- Jupyter environment for running the notebooks.
